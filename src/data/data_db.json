        "explanation": "Django version 2.2 has known security vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data. This is a high risk because exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or reputational damage. Imagine customer data being stolen or the website being defaced, resulting in loss of trust and potential legal issues. It is important to upgrade to a secure version to mitigate these risks.",

        "explanation": "The 'requests' library, version 2.10, contains security flaws that could be exploited by malicious actors. Specifically, vulnerabilities in how the library handles certain network requests could allow an attacker to intercept sensitive information or execute arbitrary code. If your application relies on 'requests' to communicate with other systems, this could be a pathway for attackers to compromise your entire infrastructure. Successful exploitation could lead to data theft, denial of service, or even complete system takeover. Upgrading to a more recent version of 'requests' that addresses these issues is crucial to protect your business.",
